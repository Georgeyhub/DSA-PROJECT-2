### Data cleaning and preparations:

The product category field was split into five subcategories using Excel's Text to Columns feature.

The first four extracted categories were merged back into the main dataset and renamed for clarity.

Analysis was primarily conducted on the main category to allow for concise and meaningful pivot table summaries.

### Analytical Techniques
Excel’s IF function was used to identify products with 50% or more discount.

COUNTIF function calculated the total count of such discounted products.

Pivot tables and summary statistics were created to explore patterns in rating counts and discount levels.

Analysis
The analysis helped answer the following questions.

-What is the average discount percentage by product category?
-How many products are listed under each category?
-What is the total number of reviews per category?
-Which products have the highest average ratings?
-What is the average actual price vs the discounted price by category?
-Which products have the highest number of reviews?
-How many products have a discount of 50% or more?
-What is the distribution of product ratings (e.g., how many products are rated 3.0, 4.0, etc.)?
-What is the total potential revenue (actual_price × rating_count) by category?
-What is the number of unique products per price range bucket (e.g., <₹200, ₹200–₹500, >₹500)?
-How does the rating relate to the level of discount?
-How many products have fewer than 1,000 reviews?
-Which categories have products with the highest discounts?
-Identify the top 5 products in terms of rating and number of reviews combined.

Recommendation
Encourage Detailed Reviews -Prompt buyers to leave comprehensive reviews, especially for discounted items, to balance the perceived value and boost engagement.

Target High-Engagement Users -Identify and engage customers who leave longer or more detailed reviews, as they tend to be more invested in the brand and products.

Leverage Sentiment Trends -Use review content (length, tone, sentiment) to guide improvements in product descriptions, features, and customer support touchpoints.
